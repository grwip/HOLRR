# Low-Rank Regression with Tensor Responses

Code for our NIPS'16 paper:

*Guillaume Rabusseau and Hachem Kadri, *Low-Rank Regression with Tensor Responses*, Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2016.*

Run `python example.py` to launch a small experiment on synthetic data and look inside to see how to use the code.


Depedencies: numpy, sklearn, scipy, [sktensor](https://github.com/mnick/scikit-tensor).
